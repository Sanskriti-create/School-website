            <p><b>
                    <centre>ABOUT
                </b><br><br>The Lawrence School - Sanawar, established in 1847, situated at a height of 1750 metres and spread over an area of 139 acres, heavily forested with pine, deodar and other conifer trees, is the fruit of the vision of Sir Henry Lawrence, and his wife Honoria.

                Sanawar is a co-educational boarding school, affiliated to CBSE and has students of varying backgrounds from different parts of the sub-continent. It provides an environment that encourages a questioning mind and gives students many avenues for expressing their creativity and building their skills.<br><br><b>LOCATION</b><br><br>It is difficult to conceive how the imagination of Sir Henry Lawrence may have first perceived that Sanawar was to be the place for his new School. On a rural hilltop at 5,600 ft, forested with pine and evergreens, Sanawar has developed over some 139 acres and is now an historical landmark in its own right. With its characteristic red roofs, visible on the horizon for miles in all directions, the estate is a veritable wonderland of rambling paths, trees, flowers and exotic birdlife. To the north, on a clear sparkling morning, the panoramic view of the snowclad peaks of the Himalayas can be seen, while to the south are rolling hills leading down to the plains. Away from distractions of city life, Sanawarian's interests are concentrated within this idyllic environment.


                Walking around the campus, the visitor can see a mixture of colonial buildings, many of which are over a century old, nestling side by side with more modern facilities which have been added to enhance both the practical needs of the school as well as the existing physical environment. One of the oldest buildings is the 149 year old School Chapel with its exquisite stained glass windows. Whilst the school has no specific religious affiliation, the Chapel is the spiritual centre of the community and regular assemblies are held in which all students and staff take part. It is the focus of memories for all Sanawarians - old and present; the daily routine includes a silent march past the War Memorials beside the Chapel. This connects the pupils of today with those of the past who have played their part in the nation's defence.


                Amongst the new buildings is the Central Dining Hall, which provides over 3,000 meals a day, an indoor Sports Complex with solar heated Swimming Pool and Squash Courts. The School is constantly upgrading its facilities. Parker Hall, now the School's Learning Resource Centre, provides easy access to archival memorabilia, up to date library resources for enhancing learning and teaching, and computer with internet facilities. In this building alone fifteen computers are installed.<br><br>

                <b>HISTORICAL FOUNDATION</b><br><br>Founded by Sir Henry and Lady Honoria Lawrence, Sanawar is believed to be the first co-educational boarding school in the world. On the 15th of April 1847, a group of 14 boys and girls camped at the top of the foothills of the Himalayas. They lived under canvas for some weeks, anxiously waiting for the first buildings to be completed before the arrival of the monsoon. Thus did Sanawar come into existence. By 1853 the strength had grown to 195 pupils and it was then the School was presented with the King's Colours. It was one of the only six schools and colleges ever to be so honoured in the entire British Empire, the others being Eton, Shrewsbury, Cheltenham, the Duke of York's Royal Military School and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. Sanawar has held its Colours for the longest unbroken period. From its Foundation the financial burden of the School was borne by Sir Henry until his death in 1857, when the government assumed responsibility for the finances as a mark of esteem to his memory. Under these arrangements, control of the School passed from the 'Honourable Board of Directors' to the Crown. This is the most unusual arrangement, not repeated in any English Public School.


                The tradition of military training at Sanawar has always been strong and of such a high standard that several contingents of boys were enlisted from the School and sent straight to the battlefields of the Great War. In appreciation of this, the School was redesignated in 1920 as the "Lawrence Royal Military School". In 1922, the Prince of Wales personally presented the School with new Colours. The School Colours continue to this day to be trooped at the Founder's Celebration in early October. Sanawar pupils continue to make a major contribution to the defence of the country.


                The Centenary year (1947) was crucial to the development of the School. With Independence, the bulk of the staff and children at Sanawar returned to the UK. However, the then Governor General, Lord Louis Mountbatten, presided over the Centenary celebrations of the school and read out a special message from King George VI. Thereafter, control of the School passed from the Crown to the Government of India, Ministry of Defence. A further transfer in 1949 brought the School under the control of the Ministry of Education and subsequently, in 1953, to the autonomous Lawrence School (Sanawar) Society. However, Sanawar retains strong links with its past. The Chairman of the Society is the Secretary for Education, Government of India and at the sesquicentenary celebrations in 1997, a message of congratulation was received from the current Prince of Wales, Prince Charles.<br><br>

                <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">Round Square is a worldwide association of schools sharing unique and ambitious goals. Its origin comes from the philosophy of Kurt Hahn who taught that schools should have a greater purpose - beyond preparing students for college and university. He believed in educating young people for life in the fullest sense. Programmes initiated by Round Square help institutionally and culturally different, but like-minded schools to work together through service projects, annual conferences, exchanges, and outdoor expeditions.<br>The title "Round Square" is derived from a seventeenth century building at Gordonstoun School in Scotland, where a group of schools founded by Kurt Hahn, his colleagues and pupils, met in 1967. They were there to form an alliance of schools, to work on aid projects for those in need; they were brought together by Jocelin Winthrop Young, and chaired by the former King Constantine of the Hellenes. Dr. Hahn did not wish his name to be affixed to the organization, so the building in which they met gave its name instead, hence the "Round Square".<br><br>
                    An annual Conference of the schools meets at a member school and is attended by Heads, Staff, Pupils and Governors, and provides a forum for the exchange of views and experience, and for the initiation and development of projects.<br><br>Member schools arrange exchange visits for pupils and teachers and undertake aid projects in places such as India, Kenya, Hungary, and Russia and the United States.

                <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">Hahn was born into a cultured Jewish family in Berlin 1886. He was a natural, gifted teacher and in the summers of his youth he would gather his friends in the family summer house pavilion and read them tales of historic adventure. Often he led them on long hikes over rough terrain.
<br>
                    After studying at Oxford University, Hahn returned to Germany just before World WarI. After the war Hahn founded Salem School in Germany, but was forced to leave the school and country because of his stance and comments against Nazism in 1933. Hahn retreated as a refugee to Scotland where he founded Gordonstoun School in April, 1934.
                    <br>Through Hahn's influence on British education, and his desire to foster physical fitness, enterprise, tenacity and compassion in the youth of the country's, Hahn formed Outward Bound in 1941. Hahn's philosophy for students was:
                    <br><b>The Seven Laws of Salem (The First Hahnian School)</b><br><br>
                    
                    1. Give Children the opportunities for self discovery.<br>
                    
                    2. Make Children meet with triumph and defeat.<br>
                    
                    3. Give Children the opportunity of self-effacement in the common cause.<br>
                    
                    4. Provide periods of silence.<br>
                    
                    5. Train the imagination.<br>
                    
                    6. Make games important but not powerful from the enervating sense of privilege.<br>
                    7. Free the sons of the wealthy and powerful from the enervating sense of privilege.<br>

The daily routine itself requires movement between dormitories, classes, dining hall, hobby and game locations spread over the 139 acre site at different levels.<br><br>

All children start the day with half an hour of PT. During the early Spring Term, this takes the form of 'Hodson Run', 3-5 kms around the school site, culminating in the fiercely fought Hodson Finals in April. During the rest of the year the children practice their mass PT movements, preparing for the Inter - House and Tattoo for the Founder's Celebration in October.<br><br>

NCC is compulsory in the senior classes and the School maintains a high standard of parade.
In addition to these compulsory activities, each child also has the option to pursue a wide range of sporting activities, both as team games and as individual pursuits, within the school time-table.

There is a growing emphasis on the audio-visual Aids in education at Sanawar. Our all classrooms are now ‚ÄúSMART CLASS ROOMS‚Äù. V-SAT classes in Science & Maths for XI & XII students are beamed from Delhi.<br> 

A monthly assessment, in which each student is discussed individually, forms a unique feature of the assessment system at Sanawar. Very bright students are encouraged with monthly awards of Achiever‚Äôs List, Distinction, Commendation and the privilege of signing the Honour's Book once a year. Weak students are placed on the HouseMaster's/Headmaster's List and are helped to do remedial work in the respective subjects. A copy of the Assessment Card is sent to the parents. At the end of each term a statement of marks and comments by the subject teachers are also sent to the parents.<br>

The School has an upto date library with a substantial collection of books and periodicals on a wide variety, accumulated over the years.<br>

The School Museum is not just a collection of articles but an educational experience in a much wider sense.</p></section>
